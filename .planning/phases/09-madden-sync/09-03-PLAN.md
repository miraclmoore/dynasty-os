# Plan 09-03: Background File Watcher + Navigation Wiring

## Goal
Optional background watcher that detects save file modifications and prompts the user to sync.
Wire the new page into navigation, App.tsx router, and Dashboard actions.

## Tasks

### Task 1: madden-watcher.ts
- [ ] `startWatching(path, onModify)` — `tauri-plugin-fs` watch() with 2s debounce
- [ ] `stopWatching()` — unwatch and clear state
- [ ] Singleton pattern (one watcher at a time)
- [ ] Add `fs:allow-watch` to capabilities

### Task 2: Integrate watcher into MaddenSyncPage
- [ ] `watcherOn` toggle in settings section
- [ ] `useEffect` starts/stops watcher based on toggle + savePath
- [ ] Bottom-fixed banner when modification detected: "Save file updated — Sync Now"
- [ ] Dismiss button clears banner; Sync Now triggers extract flow

### Task 3: Navigation wiring
- [ ] Add `madden-sync` to Page union in navigation-store.ts
- [ ] Add `goToMaddenSync()` action
- [ ] Add `case 'madden-sync'` to App.tsx router
- [ ] Add "Sync Franchise Save" button (green) in Dashboard for Madden dynasties

## Success Criteria
- Watcher starts when toggle is on + save path is set
- Modification banner appears within ~2s of save file change
- "Sync Now" triggers extract flow from the banner
- Navigation from Dashboard → MaddenSyncPage works
