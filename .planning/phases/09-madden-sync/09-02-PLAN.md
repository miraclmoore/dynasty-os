# Plan 09-02: Sync Engine + Confirmation Diff UI + Auto-Confirm Timer

## Goal
Complete the sync flow: extract game results/roster/draft data from the validated save file,
present a confirmation diff showing exactly what will change, and auto-commit after a 10-second
timer that the user can cancel.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Extract + diff pipeline (in madden-sync-service.ts)
- [ ] `extractSaveData()` invokes sidecar `extract` subcommand
- [ ] `computeSyncDiff()` maps games to Dynasty OS types, dedupes vs existing DB
- [ ] `commitSyncDiff()` writes all new records using existing service functions

### Task 2: MaddenSyncPage confirming state
- [ ] Show diff summary table: games/players/draft picks with +N new / M skipped
- [ ] Show games-to-add preview table (up to 10 rows)
- [ ] 10-second auto-confirm countdown ring
- [ ] Cancel button clears interval and returns to `validated` state
- [ ] Confirm button calls commitSyncDiff and transitions to `done`

### Task 3: Done state
- [ ] Success banner with 3 stat boxes (games/players/draft picks added)
- [ ] "Sync Again" and "Back to Dashboard" buttons

## Success Criteria
- Extracted data renders as a diff before any writes
- 10-second timer auto-commits when it reaches 0
- Cancel stops the timer without making any changes
- Done state shows accurate counts of what was saved
