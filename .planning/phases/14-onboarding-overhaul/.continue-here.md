<current_state>
Phase 14 execution is mid-checkpoint. Plan 14-01 is fully complete (3 commits). Plan 14-02 Task 1 (SetupWizard legibility fix) is committed. We are paused at the human-verify checkpoint for Plan 14-02 Task 2 — the user was testing the tour and found bugs that were fixed mid-session. The tour now works correctly but the checkpoint was never formally closed.

Additionally, while discussing Community Rosters (a separate topic), a planning decision was made for a future phase.

<completed_work>

- Plan 14-01 Task 1: Added `data-tour-id` to all 7 missing dashboard sections — commit f130541
- Plan 14-01 Task 2: Expanded TourOverlay STEPS (6→8, redesigned), fixed auto-launch via localStorage flag, rewired App.tsx/LauncherPage — commits 053b9c9, ec44d93, 098815a, 0b3d015
- Plan 14-02 Task 1: Fixed SetupWizard subtitle opacity (text-blue-300/60 → text-gray-400) — commit 80cb898
- Bug fix mid-session: Tour popup not showing (ready state race + backdrop onClick dismiss) — commit ec44d93
- Bug fix mid-session: Tour card positioned off-screen for tall elements like sidebar (clamped cardTop/cardLeft to viewport) — commit 098815a
- Tour redesign: Replaced empty-state widget steps with sidebar section steps (Program, Roster, Sport-specific), NavSection now accepts tourId prop — commit 0b3d015

</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Plan 14-02 Task 2: Human verify checkpoint — user needs to confirm all 3 ONBD requirements pass:
  - ONBD-01: Tour auto-launches after new dynasty creation and cycles through 8 steps
  - ONBD-02: ? button re-triggers tour at any time from the dashboard
  - ONBD-03: SetupWizard subtitle text is legible (no dim/opacity)
- After verification approval: continuation agent needs to commit SUMMARY.md for Plan 14-02 and update STATE.md + ROADMAP.md
- Phase 14 verifier (gsd-verifier) has not run yet — VERIFICATION.md not created
- ROADMAP.md not yet marked complete for Phase 14

</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Tour redesigned from 12 steps to 8 steps — original steps 5-12 targeted dashboard widgets that don't render on empty state (fresh dynasty); replaced with sidebar section steps (Program, Roster, sport-specific) that always exist
- `tour-sport-section` data-tour-id added to both CFB Program and NFL Franchise NavSections — tour spotlights whichever is rendered for the current dynasty
- Backdrop onClick={dismiss} removed — only explicit "Skip tour" button dismisses; prevents accidental close from the click that opened it
- Card positioning: rawCardTop clamped to [12, vh-232px] — prevents off-screen positioning for tall targets like the sidebar
- Community Rosters future work: GitHub-hosted rosters.json + 24h fetch cache in Dexie — decided but NOT yet a roadmap phase

</decisions_made>

<blockers>

- None hard blocking. Tour is functional. Pending human sign-off on ONBD-01/02/03 to close the checkpoint.

<context>
Phase 14 is essentially done functionally — all three ONBD requirements are implemented and working. The formal GSD checkpoint (Plan 14-02 Task 2) just needs the user to test and type "approved" so the continuation agent can write the SUMMARY.md and close out the phase. After that, run the verifier and mark Phase 14 complete on the roadmap.

The Community Rosters conversation was exploratory — user wants to replace the dead/placeholder links in RosterHubPage with a live GitHub-hosted manifest. This is NOT yet a roadmap phase. When creating it, the decided approach is: `community/rosters.json` in the repo, app fetches on startup with 24h TTL cache in Dexie, falls back to bundled data offline, "Updated X ago" freshness indicator in the hub header.

<next_action>
Resume the Plan 14-02 human-verify checkpoint. Ask the user: "Ready to verify? Run `pnpm --filter @dynasty-os/desktop dev` and test the 3 ONBD requirements (tour auto-launch on new dynasty, ? button re-trigger, SetupWizard legibility). Type 'approved' when all pass." Then spawn the 14-02 continuation agent to write SUMMARY.md, then run the phase verifier, then mark Phase 14 complete.

After Phase 14 is closed: create a new roadmap phase for the Community Rosters GitHub-manifest system.
