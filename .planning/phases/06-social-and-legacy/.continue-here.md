<current_state>
Phase 6 (Social and Legacy) is 100% complete and verified. All 3 plans executed, 12/12 must-haves verified, 6 requirements marked Complete. The next action is planning Phase 7 (Achievements).

There is NO in-progress work. This is a clean phase boundary pause.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- 06-01: Rivalry Tracker — DB v4 migration (rivals + scoutingNotes tables), Rival type, CRUD + calculateRivalryIntensity, RivalryTrackerPage with H2H auto-calc via getHeadToHeadRecords, streak indicators, amber 10-pip intensity display, last-3-games, Dashboard CFB button
- 06-02: Program Timeline — timeline-service.ts aggregating season nodes + localStorage taglines, ProgramTimelinePage with oldest-first scrollable cards (year, record, conf record, ranking, bowl result, tagline, key events), CSS @media print PDF via window.print(), Dashboard CFB button
- 06-03: Scouting Cards — ScoutingNote type (replaced Record<string,unknown> placeholder), upsertScoutingNote (one-note-per-opponent), ScoutingCardPage two-panel layout (opponent search left, card detail right), H2H record + recent games + tendency notes edit/save/cancel, sport-agnostic Dashboard button
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
None in Phase 6.

Next: Phase 7 — Achievements
- 07-01: Achievement engine — milestone condition definitions, evaluation hooks on save events, achievement state persistence
- 07-02: Trophy room and coaching resume — earned achievement display, resume stats aggregation view
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- DB_VERSION bumped 3→4 in 06-01 with rivals + scoutingNotes tables — both available for Phase 6 plans
- calculateRivalryIntensity(totalGames): Math.min(10, Math.ceil(totalGames / 2)) — 1-10 scale, pure function
- Rivalry Tracker is CFB Program section (sport-specific positioning); Scouting Cards is sport-agnostic (outside CFB guard)
- PDF export via window.print() + CSS @media print — no extra library (blob downloads blocked in Tauri WebView)
- Timeline service is pure read (no Zustand store) — getTimelineNodes called directly from page
- ScoutingNote uses [dynastyId+opponent] compound Dexie index for efficient upsert lookup
- navigation-store.ts now has: 'rivalry-tracker', 'program-timeline', 'scouting-card' page types
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None. Phase 6 is clean. 4 items flagged for human testing (not blockers):
- Live H2H data with real games logged
- Tagline display from narrative cache
- Tauri print output visually
- Notes persistence across navigation
</blockers>

<context>
Phase 6 was executed in 3 sequential plans (~19 min total) because 06-01/02/03 all touch navigation-store.ts, DashboardPage.tsx, and App.tsx — parallelizing without worktree isolation would cause conflicts. Plans ran cleanly with no deviations.

Phase 7 (Achievements) adds the achievement engine that hooks into existing data save events. Phase 7 depends on Phase 6 having a full data set — which it now does.

<next_action>
Start with: /gsd:plan-phase 7

Or if you want to discuss approach first: /gsd:discuss-phase 7

No context restoration needed — Phase 6 is fully committed and closed.
