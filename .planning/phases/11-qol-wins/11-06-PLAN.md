<objective>
Human verification of all 10 QOL features delivered in Wave 1 plans (11-01 through 11-05). Claude runs a build check; the user does an interactive walkthrough in the running app.

Purpose: These are UI-heavy changes — toasts, modal chips, scrubber, checklist — that require a human eye to confirm correct visual rendering and interaction behavior.

Output: All QOL features approved or issues logged for gap closure.

Run the full build to confirm all five plans compiled without errors:
```bash
cd /Users/chanmoore/dev/dynasty-os && pnpm --filter @dynasty-os/desktop build
```

Also verify key implementation markers are present:
```bash
grep -rn "useToastStore.getState()" apps/desktop/src/store/game-store.ts apps/desktop/src/store/player-store.ts apps/desktop/src/store/season-store.ts apps/desktop/src/store/player-season-store.ts
grep -n "useFilterStore" apps/desktop/src/store/dynasty-store.ts apps/desktop/src/pages/RosterPage.tsx
grep -n "Command.Dialog" apps/desktop/src/components/CommandPalette.tsx
grep -n "exportTableToCsv" apps/desktop/src/pages/RosterPage.tsx
grep -n "dynasty-os-checklist" apps/desktop/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx
grep -n "scrollIntoView" apps/desktop/src/pages/ProgramTimelinePage.tsx
grep -rn "window.confirm" apps/desktop/src/ || echo "CLEAN: no window.confirm found"
```

Report results. If build fails or any grep returns unexpected results, fix before proceeding to checkpoint.

  <how-to-verify>
Start the app: `pnpm --filter @dynasty-os/desktop dev` (or use the running dev server).

Work through the following checks:

**QOL-01 Toast:**
1. Log a game — confirm green "Game logged" toast appears bottom-right
2. Edit a player — confirm "Player updated" toast appears
3. Save season end data — confirm "Season data saved" toast appears

**QOL-02 Undo:**
4. Delete a game from the game log — confirm toast with "Undo" action button appears (no blocking confirm dialog)
5. Click the Undo button — confirm the game reappears in the game log
6. Delete a player from RosterPage — confirm same toast-undo pattern (no window.confirm)

**QOL-03 Filter persistence:**
7. On RosterPage, set position filter to any specific position
8. Navigate to a player profile then click Back
9. Confirm the position filter is still the one you set

**QOL-04 Command palette:**
10. Press Cmd+K (Mac) or Ctrl+K (Windows) — confirm palette opens with input focused
11. Type "rost" — confirm "Roster" item appears in the list
12. Press Enter or click — confirm navigation to RosterPage and palette closes
13. Press Cmd+K again — palette reopens. Press Escape — palette closes

**QOL-05 CSV export:**
14. On RosterPage, click "Export CSV" — confirm OS file save dialog appears
15. Save the file and open it in a text editor — confirm it has correct CSV headers and player data

**QOL-06 Year auto-suggest:**
16. With an active season, look for "+ New Season" button in the Dashboard sidebar
17. Click it — confirm a new season is created with year = current season year + 1

**QOL-07 Recent opponents:**
18. Open Log Game modal — confirm recent opponents chips appear above the team selector (only if 1+ games already logged)
19. Click one chip — confirm the opponent field fills with that team name

**QOL-08 Player notes:**
20. Open Edit Player modal for any player — confirm a Notes textarea is present
21. Type a note and save
22. Open the player profile — confirm the notes section displays the saved text

**QOL-09 Season checklist:**
23. On Dashboard with an active season, confirm the Season Checklist widget is visible
24. Check a task — confirm it shows strikethrough text
25. Navigate to Roster and back — confirm the checkbox is still checked

**QOL-10 Timeline scrubber:**
26. Open Program Timeline for a dynasty with 2+ seasons
27. Confirm a horizontal scrubber with year pills appears at the top of the page
28. Click the earliest year — confirm the page scrolls to that season node
